  --card-background: hsl(244, 38%, 16%);
  --accent: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
  --main-heading: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --text-secondary: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
  --text-secondary-card: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.6);
}
```

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('Hello')
}
