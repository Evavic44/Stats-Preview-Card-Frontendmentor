### Overview

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 styling
- No frameworks or programming language was used. Just plain old HTML, CSS

### What I learned
<h4>Building this project has helped me to fortify my CSS skills in the following departments</h4>

- Alignment: This is one of the issues I struggled with. After adding the flex property to the column classes, the card box was too spaced out and elements shrinked on smaller screens, by adding the `max-width` and ```margin: 0 auto;``` property, the text properly aligned to the container. _This might help if you plan on taking this challenge_

### Code Snippets
I added the provided color code pallete to a var property as seen below. This pallete was really helpful to me _adding it to a variable for easy reference is highly recommended_.

```css
:root {
  --main-background: hsl(233, 47%, 7%);
  --card-background: hsl(244, 38%, 16%);
  --accent: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
  --main-heading: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --text-secondary: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
  --text-secondary-card: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.6);
}
```


Since the font family link was gracefully provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) on google fonts, I added it to the `css` easily using the css import property. _Do check it out for adding the fonts easily [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?query=inter)_
```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;700&family=Lexend+Deca&display=swap');
```

### Continued development
Going forward, I would like to improve on my `CSS` skills -primarily on Alignment and Positioning. WHY!? well because I'm not quite satisfied with the length of `CSS` code I wrote to achieve this owing that to the alignment sections of this challenge.   

### Useful resources

- [Cooolors](https://www.cooolors.co) - This helped me to generate and convert the `HSL` css color codes to `HEX` which I'm probably more used to.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
